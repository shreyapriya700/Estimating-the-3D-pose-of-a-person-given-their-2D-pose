# Estimating-the-3D-pose-of-a-person-given-their-2D-pose
In this homework we are going to work on estimating the 3D pose of a person given their 2D pose. Turns out, just regressing the 3D pose coordinates using the 2D pose works pretty well [1] (you can find the paper here). In Part One, we are going to work on reproducing the results of the paper, in Part Two, we are going to try to find a way to handle noisy measurement.
